# **Equal Access, Unequal Outcomes: A Clustering Analysis of Advanced Coursework and Postsecondary Outcomes** 📊📚🎓

Welcome to the repository for the project conducted as part of **ORLA 6541: Data Science for Organizations and Leadership** at Teachers College, Columbia University. This project examined the role structural barriers played in the relationship between access to advanced coursework and postsecondary outcomes in North Carolina high schools. 

## **Abstract** 📝
The study investigates the relationship between structural barriers, advanced coursework access, and postsecondary outcomes. Using data from the **Civil Rights Data Collection** and the **North Carolina Department of Public Instruction**, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to 239 high schools. Results were visualized using heatmaps and bubble plots, revealing four distinct school clusters. Economically disadvantaged schools face significant challenges, though some excelled through targeted interventions. The findings highlight the need for solutions that address structural inequities and enhance access to advanced coursework.
